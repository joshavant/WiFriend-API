# WiFriend API

**A RESTful API implementation in Rails.**

## Overview
This is a demonstration of design patterns and architectural decisions for one approach of implementing a RESTful API in Rails.

## Discussion
This is an unfinished project that I'm publishing at the request of colleagues to see how I'm designing a RESTful API for my side iOS projects. Over time, I intend this repo to morph intoÂ a fully complete, open-source backend for my iOS app, WiFriend (which will also be open-source).

I settled on [Rabl](http://github.com/nesquena/rabl) for JSON templating and [Koala](http://github.com/arsduo/koala) for Facebook Graph API interactions.

To version the API, I created a namespace for the Api and then a version-specific namespace, inside of that (i.e. `Api::V1::FooController`).

The URI design of the API was designed as: `http://api.domain.com/v1/endpoint`

To handle various exceptions consistently across endpoints, I created a `BaseController` that all controllers inherit from. This controller implements `rescue_from` and handles both general and Facebook-specific exceptions (i.e. [`OAuthException`](http://developers.facebook.com/docs/authentication/access-token-expiration/)) and dispatches error responses.

My error response behavior is responding with an appropriate HTTP status code (so networking frameworks can observe and handle errors with failure-specific behavior, accordingly). I also return a JSON object with the HTTP status code and a descriptive error message.
